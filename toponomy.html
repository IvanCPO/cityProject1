            <h2>Bell tower of San Marcos</h2>
            <p>If you want to be able to contemplate a magnificent view of Venice and take a panoramic photo of the city, you have to climb the highest bell tower in the city: the Campanille de San Marco. Its almost 100 meters high keep the traditional story of the Flight of the Angel, a magnificent balance exercise in which an acrobat passes across from the Campanille to the Ducal Palace.</p>
