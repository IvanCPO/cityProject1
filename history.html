            <h2>Fundution</h2>
            <p>Until its foundation, it was inhabited by a few Illyrian and Venetian inhabitants who lived on the water of the lagoon in stilt houses subsisting on fishing and salt extraction.</p>
            <p>Its foundation dates back to the year 421. The inhabitants of Veneto, expelled by the Ostrogoths and the Lombards, took refuge in these marshy lands at the mouth of the River Po, constituting the city of Venice.</p>
            <p>Their geographical location made it very difficult to receive enemy invasions against them until, in the 6th century, the great general of Justinian's time, Belisarius, conquered Venice. Under the protection of the Byzantine Empire, it became administratively dependent on the Exarch of Ravenna.</p>
            <p>In the year 829, the body of the apostle Saint Mark, the evangelist who would be the patron saint of the city, was transported to Venice from Alexandria.</p>
            <p>In 976 a fire destroyed the center of the city, including the Doge's Palace, with the city archives and the first church of San Marcos.</p>
            <p>Venice expanded its power by trading silks and spices from Constantinople (ancient Byzantium) and Alexandria, transporting slaves, timber, fish from Dalmatia, iron from the Alps, and cloth. One of the most productive businesses was the purchase of slaves from the south of Russia to sell them in North Africa. She also sold in Europe what she bought in Alexandria and Turkey.</p>
            <p>Sign of the peak was the minting, in the year 1284, of a gold coin, the Ducat, which would remain for three centuries as one of the world's monetary standards along with the Florentine florin.</p>

            <h2>The arrival of decadence</h2>
            <p>If the conquest of Constantinople was the beginning of its heyday, its loss, in 1453 at the hands of the Turks, began a galloping decline. To this was added the discovery of America that displaced commercial currents.</p>
            <p>At that time they were threatened and lost part of their territories</p>
            <p>The plague of 1630 wiped out a third of the population. The decline of Venice was manifest, the Habsburgs strengthened the Port of Trieste against Venetian interests. Naples tried to dominate it through the Conspiracy of Venice.</p>

                <h2>Il serpente della Laguna</h2>
                <p>The legend was about a great snake that appeared every Saturday night that killed fishermen who dared to fish. That giant snake was really a mermaid that underwent this transformation and ended up falling in love with a man, with whom she married. Some time later she had three children and the mermaid died without ever transforming back into that beast. It is said that every Saturday the Man went to that lake to honor his deceased wife and left the children at home but one day he arrived earlier and instead of seeing his children he saw three giant snakes which he ended up killing, leaving only him man.</p>

                <h2>Il Fantasma del Gran Canal</h2>
                <p>The story is about a married couple, Fosco and Elena, who after a fight ends up killing the woman by decapitating her with the sword. After a long time in which he had to go with his dead wife to Rome and return to sentence him to the same death, he decides to throw himself down the Grand Canal and die subject to his wife. It is said that there are people who see his ghost in the Grand Canal at night holding the head of his screaming wife.</p>
