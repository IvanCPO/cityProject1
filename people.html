        <p> Venezia is more famous in Italy and in the world for to be one of the most beautiful place in the world.
            Many people visit this place, regardless of the time of year for its beauty and the feeling of peace and tranquility that it brings, but really how many people live there and how many visitors can come depending on the season?</p>

            <h2>Residents</h2>
            <p>Venice currently has a number of 49,997 residents, which is lower in number than in previous years. I think that it is surely due to the climatic change that is taking place all over the world, causing the sea level to increase to a greater extent.</p>
            <p>In general, the spring and early autumn months are the most comfortable if all the circumstances are analyzed.</p>
